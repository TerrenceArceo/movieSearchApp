# movieSearchApp
A simple Movie searching app using React, and TMBd API

## Overview
This is the 4th project that I had built as I progress through Scrimba Front-end career path.
I learned about Class-base-components, funtional component, useState, state, props, forms, etc..

In this project, I implemented functional components, props, and component to create a cleaner, more manageable environment.
